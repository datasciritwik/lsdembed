## Overview

LSdembed is a revolutionary text embedding library that models text tokens as particles in a physical system. Unlike traditional embedding methods that rely purely on statistical or neural approaches, LSdembed uses classical mechanics principles to simulate semantic relationships through particle interactions.

The core insight is that **semantic similarity can be modeled as physical forces**: similar tokens attract each other, while dissimilar tokens repel. By simulating this particle system until equilibrium, we obtain embeddings that capture nuanced semantic relationships.

## Core Physics Concepts

### 1. Particle System Model

Each token in a text sequence is represented as a **particle** in a high-dimensional space with the following properties:

- **Position**: $`q_i ∈ ℝ^d`$ - The embedding vector for token i
- **Velocity**: $`v_i ∈ ℝ^d`$ - Rate of change of position
- **Mass**: $`m_i`$ - Derived from Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

### 2. Force Model

The system implements two fundamental forces:

#### Universal Repulsion Force
All particles repel each other with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance:

$$
F_{\text{repulsion}}(i, j) = \alpha \cdot \frac{q_i - q_j}{\|q_i - q_j\|^3}
$$


Where:
- `α` (alpha) is the repulsion strength parameter
- $`||q_i - q_j||`$ is the Euclidean distance between particles i and j

**Physical Interpretation**: This models the principle that all tokens have some degree of semantic distinctiveness. The repulsion prevents all embeddings from collapsing to a single point.

#### Sequential Spring Attraction
Adjacent tokens in the sequence are connected by springs:


$$F_attraction(i,i+1) = β * (q_{i+1} - q_i)
$$

Where:
- `β` (beta) is the attraction strength parameter
- Only consecutive tokens experience this force

**Physical Interpretation**: This captures the contextual relationship between adjacent words in natural language, similar to how words derive meaning from their immediate context.

### 3. Damped Motion Dynamics

The system uses **damped harmonic motion** to reach equilibrium:

$$m_i * d²q_i/dt² = F_total(i) - γ * dq_i/dt
$$
Where:
- `γ` (gamma) is the damping coefficient
- $`F_total(i)`$ is the sum of all forces acting on particle i

**Physical Interpretation**: Damping ensures the system converges to a stable configuration rather than oscillating indefinitely.

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Force Calculation

The total force on particle i is computed as:

$$F_total(i) = Σ_{j≠i} F_repulsion(i,j) + F_attraction(i) - γ * v_i$$

#### Repulsion Force (Detailed)
For particles i and j separated by distance r:

$$F_rep = α * r̂ / r²
$$
Where $`r̂ = (q_i - q_j) / ||q_i - q_j||`$ is the unit vector pointing from j to i.

**Cutoff Radius**: To improve computational efficiency and physical realism, forces are only calculated for particles within a cutoff radius $`r_cutoff`$:


$$F_rep = {
  α * r̂ / r²,  if r < r_cutoff
  0,            if r ≥ r_cutoff
}
$$
#### Spring Attraction (Detailed)
The spring force between consecutive tokens follows Hooke's law:

$$F_spring(i,i+1) = -β * (q_i - q_{i+1})$$

This creates a restoring force that pulls adjacent tokens toward their equilibrium separation.

### 2. Numerical Integration

The system uses the **Velocity Verlet algorithm** for stable numerical integration:

#### Position Update:
$$q_i(t + dt) = q_i(t) + v_i(t) * dt + 0.5 * a_i(t) * dt²$$

#### Velocity Update:
$$v_i(t + dt) = v_i(t) + 0.5 * [a_i(t) + a_i(t + dt)] * dt
$$
Where $`a_i(t) = F_total(i,t) / m_i`$ is the acceleration.

**Advantages of Velocity Verlet**:
- Time-reversible and symplectic
- Conserves energy in the absence of damping
- Stable for moderate time steps

### 3. Mass Assignment

Particle masses are derived from **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:

```
IDF(token) = log(N / (df(token) + 1))
mass(token) = 1 / (IDF(token) + ε)
```

Where:
- `N` is the total number of documents/chunks
- $`df(token)`$ is the document frequency of the token
- `ε` is a small constant to prevent division by zero

**Semantic Interpretation**: 
- **Rare words** (high IDF) → **low mass** → more responsive to forces
- **Common words** (low IDF) → **high mass** → more inertial, stable positions

### 4. Embedding Extraction

After simulation convergence, the final embedding for a text sequence is computed as a **weighted centroid**:

$$embedding = Σ_i (w_i * q_i) / Σ_i w_i$$

Where $`w_i = 1/m_i`$ is the importance weight (inverse of mass).

This gives more influence to rare, semantically important words.

## Algorithm Implementation

### 1. Initialization Phase

* $q_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \text{scale}^2)$
* $v_i = 0$

The `scale` parameter controls the initial spread of particles in the embedding space.

### 2. Simulation Loop

```python
for step in range(num_steps):
    # 1. Compute forces
    forces = compute_all_forces(positions)
    
    # 2. Calculate accelerations
    accelerations = forces / masses
    
    # 3. Update positions (Verlet integration)
    positions += velocities * dt + 0.5 * accelerations * dt²
    
    # 4. Compute new forces
    new_forces = compute_all_forces(positions)
    new_accelerations = new_forces / masses
    
    # 5. Update velocities
    velocities += 0.5 * (accelerations + new_accelerations) * dt
```

### 3. Convergence Criteria

The simulation runs for a fixed number of steps, typically equal to the number of tokens. This ensures sufficient time for the system to reach near-equilibrium while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Physics Parameters and Their Effects

### 1. Dimension (`d`)
- **Range**: 64-1024 (typical: 256-512)
- **Effect**: Higher dimensions allow more nuanced semantic distinctions but require more memory
- **Trade-off**: Quality vs. computational cost

### 2. Repulsion Strength (`α`)
- **Range**: 0.5-3.0 (typical: 1.0-2.0)
- **Effect**: Controls how strongly dissimilar tokens repel
- **High α**: More separated, distinct embeddings
- **Low α**: More compact embedding space

### 3. Attraction Strength (`β`)
- **Range**: 0.1-1.0 (typical: 0.3-0.8)
- **Effect**: Controls sequential coherence
- **High β**: Strong contextual binding
- **Low β**: More independent token representations

### 4. Damping Coefficient (`γ`)
- **Range**: 0.1-0.5 (typical: 0.2)
- **Effect**: Controls convergence speed
- **High γ**: Faster convergence, potential underdamping
- **Low γ**: Slower convergence, better quality

### 5. Cutoff Radius (`r_cutoff`)
- **Range**: 1.5-5.0 (typical: 2.5-3.5)
- **Effect**: Limits interaction range
- **Large r_cutoff**: More global interactions, slower computation
- **Small r_cutoff**: More local interactions, faster computation

### 6. Time Step (`dt`)
- **Range**: 0.01-0.1 (typical: 0.05)
- **Effect**: Integration stability vs. speed
- **Small dt**: More stable, slower
- **Large dt**: Faster, potential instability

## Computational Optimizations

### 1. Spatial Hashing

The implementation uses a **spatial hash grid** to reduce force calculation complexity from O(N²) to approximately O(N):

```cpp
class SpatialHashGrid {
    // Hash function for 3D coordinates
    uint64_t hash_position(const std::vector<double>& pos) {
        int x = floor(pos[0] / cell_size);
        int y = floor(pos[1] / cell_size);
        int z = floor(pos[2] / cell_size);
        return x * 73856093ULL ^ y * 19349663ULL ^ z * 83492791ULL;
    }
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Only particles in nearby cells interact
- Dramatic speedup for large token sequences
- Memory-efficient neighbor finding

### 2. OpenMP Parallelization

Force calculations are parallelized across multiple threads:

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    // Compute forces for particle i
    compute_particle_forces(i, positions, forces);
}
```

**Optimizations**:
- Dynamic scheduling for load balancing
- Memory-aware thread count adjustment
- Atomic operations for force accumulation

### 3. Memory Management

The system implements several memory optimizations:

- **Chunked Processing**: Large corpora are processed in batches
- **Compressed Storage**: Model persistence uses compression
- **Memory Monitoring**: Automatic thread count adjustment based on available memory

## Semantic Interpretation

### 1. Embedding Space Properties

The resulting embedding space has several desirable properties:

- **Semantic Clustering**: Similar tokens naturally cluster together due to reduced repulsion
- **Contextual Coherence**: Sequential attraction preserves local context
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Different scales of similarity emerge naturally

### 2. Distance Metrics

In the final embedding space:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures semantic relatedness
- **Euclidean Distance**: Captures both semantic and contextual differences
- **Angular Distance**: Emphasizes semantic direction over magnitude

### 3. Normalization

The final embeddings undergo **corpus-level normalization**:

```python
# Center embeddings around corpus mean
centered = embeddings - corpus_center

# Normalize to unit length
normalized = centered / ||centered||
```

This ensures:
- **Translation Invariance**: Absolute position doesn't matter
- **Scale Invariance**: Magnitude normalization for fair comparison
- **Improved Similarity Metrics**: Better cosine similarity behavior

## Conclusion

LSdembed represents a novel approach to text embedding that bridges the gap between linguistic intuition and physical modeling. By treating semantic relationships as physical forces, the system naturally discovers embedding structures that capture both local context and global semantic patterns.

The physics-inspired approach offers several advantages:

1. **Interpretability**: Each parameter has a clear physical meaning
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust behavior for different domains
3. **Robustness**: Physical constraints prevent pathological embeddings
4. **Scalability**: Optimized algorithms handle large corpora efficiently

The mathematical foundation ensures that the embeddings are not only semantically meaningful but also computationally tractable, making LSdembed a powerful tool for modern NLP applications.
